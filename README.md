This is a finite grid simulation of Conway's Game Of Life.

It has three modes. Random mode randomly chooses alive cells in the grid. 
Template mode contains several preset initial configurations.
Custom mode lets us make our own initial configuration.

Can modify cell_size value to zoom in or out the grid.
